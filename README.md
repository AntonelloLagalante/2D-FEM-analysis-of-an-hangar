# 2D FEM analysis of an hangar

  Project held at the Politecnico di Milano in the exam "Dynamics of Mechanical Systems" held by prof. Bruni. 
  
FEM (Finite Element Method) analysis of an hangar structure for aircraft parking.

Main required results are:
- FE model definition of the structure in a certain frequency range
- Determination of natural frequencies and modes of vibration
- Different frequency response functions as a result of different input forces acting on the system at different nodes
- Design of a modified structure to reduce the clamping moment in one of the two pillars under different constraints
